							***Cap Stone project (Intrusion detector)***

-Project  implemented all on google colab except visualizaions imported from visuals file
are implemented localy


-Runtime type: python 3
-Hardware Accelerator: GPU



-Data of the project are downloaded and extracted from this link:
https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/nsl.html?fbclid=IwAR3fJFxBM_mqWcteKk9q0i5uY6eEGbdwZSxjBjlaSTv06ViXWTG4-RZ5M_I




---->>The final data files used are uploaded on google drive and here is the link of the two csv files used (train and test):
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1behXkVjvwA_gX6cVZmoLIRu0kPTXwRFq?usp=sharing


-Libiraries needed:
Numpy
Pandas
Keras
Sklearn
Tensorflow
Matplotlib
Visuals file ---> included with the project

-Training CNN model need to freespace memory of GPU on colab to avoid getting Error of memory limitaion.


-If there is a need to connect google drive with colab you will need import:
GoogleCredentials
auth
getpass
